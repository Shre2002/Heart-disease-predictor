# Heart-disease-predictor
This is a repository that contains a testing of heart disease predictor accuracy using different machine learning techniques
Here we will be using a sample dataset on our prediction model to find the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms used

As far as we've seen, we obtain the following accuracy percentage for the following techniques.

K NEAREST NEIGHBOR : 68.85%

SVM + XGBOOST : 95.8%

LINEAR REGRESSION : 88.52%

RANDOM FOREST : 86.88%
